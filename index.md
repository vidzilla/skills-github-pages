title: Programming Finite Element Analysis for Structural Engineers
---
I started this blog series to address an extremely glaring gap in the FEA world - there are vanishingly small resources out there catered specifically towards programming FEA for structural engineers. The canonical texts (Zienkiewicz, Irons, Bathe) are nearly all focused on mechanical engineering (my speciic gripe being they flip over very very quickly to shell and solid element FEA). 
Structual engineering works typically do NOT need sold elements. In fact, we do not even WANT solid elements. Heck a fair subset among us even hate using shell elements.
